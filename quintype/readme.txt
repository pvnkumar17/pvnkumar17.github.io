1. This is example site for dynamic stories. (Stories will be loading as a JSON data). Feature includes responsive, infinite scroll and rotating text for must read.
2.  This site is based on html5, css3,  javascript,  jQuery and json.
3. As json data is coming from cross domain so you will have to install chrome extension to view this site. 
4. I have given reference below to install chrome extension

5. As this is responsive site feel free to use any type of devices.
6. Extra: if you have node with gulp installed in your system then you can use gulp.js file as a local server or else you can ignore this file.
